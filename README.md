# CZ4031 Project 1
## Build Instructions
To build, first make sure you have [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) properly installed and configured. Operating system should not matter.

1. In the project root folder, create a new folder named `build`.

2. Inside `build`, execute `cmake ..`.

3. Execute `make`.
4. An executable named `LmaoDB` should now appear in `build`. Before you run it, you should first move it to root folder of project, as executable must be within same folder as `data.tsv`.
